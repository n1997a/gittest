Cristiano Ronaldo's move from Real Madrid to Juventus isn't just the second-biggest transfer in history -- the deal, once you factor in wages, transfer fee and commissions, will be comfortably north of $350 million, surpassed only by Neymar -- it's also an enormous gamble for everyone involved.
Real Madrid lose their talisman, their alpha and omega, capable of scoring a goal per game last season.
Juventus stretch their resources in an attempt to make a giant leap forward, abandoning the blueprint of organic growth that had guided them in the past seven seasons and, in a financial fair play world, rolling the dice that they won't have to dismantle the squad.
He is leaving arguably the biggest club in the world, a city where he is settled and a league where he is comfortable and dominant to go to Serie A, which as of right now is a step beneath La Liga.
And before people call him greedy and wave Euro bills in his face, remember that based on the figures released, he will be earning no more (and possibly less when you consider endorsements, given that Real Madrid offer greater visibility) than he would have if he had signed the extension Madrid offered him last month.
At 33, Ronaldo is the age at which most professionals either squeeze another season or two at the highest possible level from their bodies or, if they can't do it anymore, downshift and make a "lifestyle" choice.
The trust isn't there, and to Ronaldo, it has manifested itself in a number of ways, from the fact that the club didn't do more to appeal his five-match ban earlier this year to the fact that some at the highest level have drawn up post-Zinedine Zidane rebuilding plans that do not involve Ronaldo.
At that stage, he had a little over two years left on his contract and the club figured they were at a crossroads.
Ronaldo ended the season with 21 goals in his final 19 matches in all competitions, while leading Real Madrid to their 11th European Cup and a month later, was key in propelling Portugal to their first ever major trophy, Euro 2016.
While the club continued to believe that Ronaldo would inevitably decline to the point that a massive contract extension would be ill-advised, they ended up biting the bullet and on November 6, 2016, extended his deal through 2021.
Ronaldo was happy with the new deal, of course, but equally disappointed that the club lacked faith in his ability to continue to perform.
He helped Madrid to another European Cup at the end of that campaign and yet another in May. But the standoff continued.
Since extending his contract, he delivered industrial quantities of goals, European Cups and won Ballons' D'Or every year.
Given his history of signing the biggest stars, you can't help but feel that this is a first, painful step towards clearing the way to bring in another Galactico -- something they haven't done in a while - such as Kylian Mbappe, Neymar or Eden Hazard.</p></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-3 col-md-4 col-sm-6 portfolio-item"><div class="card h-100"><a href="#"><img class="card-img-top" src="img/700_400_1531232170_815783_1531244364_noticia_normal.jpg" alt=""></a><div class="card-body"><h4 class="card-title"><a href="https://en.as.com/en/2018/07/10/football/1531232170_815783.html">Cristiano Ronaldo leaves Real Madrid, signs for Juventus live</a></h4><p class="card-text">Cristiano Ronaldo leaves Real Madrid, signs for Juventus live

Ronaldo's lowest return in a season at Real Madrid was 33 goals in 2009-10
Ronaldo joined Real from Manchester United for 80m in July 2009 and scored a club-record 451 goals and won the Ballon D'Or - awarded to the world's best footballer - in 2008, 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017.

"For Real Madrid Cristiano Ronaldo will always be one of the great symbols," said a club statement.
"Real Madrid wants to express its gratitude to a player who has proved to be the best in the world and who has marked one of the brightest times in the history of our club and world football.
Real are keen on reshaping their team under new manager Julen Lopetegui and the 33-time La Liga winners have also been linked with a move for Paris St-Germain's 26-year-old Brazil forward Neymar.
However, it would be a controversial move as Neymar spent four years at Real's fierce rivals Barcelona before joining PSG in his world record transfer of 200m last summer.
Real have also been linked with a move for another PSG forward, Mbappe, the 19-year-old who has helped France reach the semi-finals of the World Cup. Italian football expert James Horncastle told BBC Radio 5 live: "Real would be reluctant to lose Ronaldo without a replacement in hand.
They have been linked with Neymar, who joined PSG for a world record fee last season, and their flirting with the Brazilian appears to have put Ronaldo's nose out of joint at Madrid.

According to The Guardian , the 33-year-old soccer star met with his agent and Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli in Greece and agreed to a four-year deal, with an annual salary of around 30 million ($35.2 million).
That means that Ronaldo can expect to earn roughly 120 million ($140.78 million) over his four-year contract.
In a statement , Real Madrid thanked the player for his dedication over his nine years at the club and said, "Real Madrid will always be your home.
According to Forbes' ranking of the 100 highest-paid athletes in the world, the Portuguese striker earns approximately $61 million in salary and winnings and $47 million in endorsements each year, for a total of $108 million.
In June, Spanish publication El Mundo reported that he had accepted a suspended two-year prison sentence and agreed to pay $21.7 million.
Ronaldo has a collection that would make any car-lover jealous, and often posts photos on Instagram showing off his expensive wheels.
After winning the Euro Cup in 2016, Ronaldo showed off a Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport worth approximately $1.97 million.
According to Bleacher Report , his collection is likely worth over $4.9 million.
Ronaldo owns several homes, but the most famous is his 5.4 million ($7.1 million) luxury villa in Madrid , which served as his home base while he played for Real Madrid.
In 2015, Ronaldo paid Italian real estate entrepreneur Alessandro Proto $18.5 million for an apartment in New York City's Trump Tower .
Now that he will be playing in Italy, we can expect Ronaldo to make some changes to his real estate investments.
